# A Sample problem covering Monte Carlo methods

A forest consisting of 1000 trees forms a perfect 50x20 rectangle. The northwestern(top-left) corner tree catches fire. The wind blows from the west, therefore the probability that any tree catches fire from its burning left neighbour is 0.8. The probability of catching fire from trees immediately to the right, above, or below are all equal to 0.3. Trees cannot catch fire diagonally in this problem.

a)	Construct a Monte Carlo study to estimate the probability that more than 30% of the forest will eventually be burning. With a probability of 0.95, your answer should differ from the true value by no more than 0.005. <br />
Answer = 0.7667
    
b)	 Based on the same study, predict the total number of affected trees X. <br />
Answer = 767.113
    
c)	 Estimate std(X) and comment on the accuracy of your estimator of X. <br />
Answer = 422.029
    
d)	 What is the probability that the actual number of affected trees differs from your estimator by more than 25 trees? <br />
Answer = 1
    
e)	 A wooden house is located in the northeastern corner of the forest. Would you advise the owner that their house is in real danger? <br />
Answer = The probability of his house catching fire is 0.767, so yes! I would advise the owner to leave their house immediately!
